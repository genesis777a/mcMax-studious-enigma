* = an automated plugging tool.
* BOT-able -> random walk.
* simulates a PC virus behavior.
* super useful for finding 'holes' in the system 🦠

## 'Game' logic:
* Implementation: A-path finding algorithm. /array/
* Collaborative behavior reinforcement learning (*MARL) -> graph neural network (GNN)

* Two one-brick pre-trained [9-connectors!] neural networks are set to escape the maze grid ⊞
* The board can be further customized (adding more /complex/ logical operations, for ex., building side-player agents' behavior trees in video gaming).

* The container [[.382]] is -on purposely- isolated from the Project_381 for analysis purposes.
* = the pursuit of finding ideal algorithms that maximize rewards with a less invasive, non-tensor set of concepts.
* {In} Hidden segmentations, black and red arrays, encrypted tags.
